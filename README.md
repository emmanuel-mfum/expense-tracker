# expense-tracker
Expense tracker by year and month designed with React

The goal of this project was to understand the basics upon which React is build on ; namely, JavaScrpit ES6 syntax, React components,
React state, listening to events (clicks or changes on a component), dynamically rendering lists and rendering components or code
conditionally.

The result is this SPA (single-page application) that can keep track of expenses by year and can display the proportion of the amounts 
of money spent across the different months of the year in a chart.

The user can add new expenses, but they won't be saved as this is a front-end only application for now.
